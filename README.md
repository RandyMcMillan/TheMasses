The scans of The Masses in this folder were made in the period of 2011 and 2012 by Tamiment Library, of their stunning complete collection of originals of this magazine.  My understanding is they were made using a high resolution digital camera and copy stand, then post-processed considerably to produce the scans presented here.

The Riazanov Library and the Marxist Internet Archive have explicitly been given permission to distribute these images in a not for profit fashion.  My understanding, based on personal communications with the former chief archivist at Tamiment Library Peter Filardo, with the late Director of Tamiment Library Dr. Michael Nash, and with the current acting director of Tamiment Library Chela Scott Weber, is that Tamiment Library wishes these images to be freely distributed and redictributed, as long as such is done in a for free / not for profit fashion.  Tamiment Library is to be HIGHLY praised by the community of researchers, scholars, and all members of the workers movement for this socially-positive and generous approach to the digital information it has created.

Anyone seeking to make a profit off these images, or anything created using them, must contact Tamiment Library who, quite appropriately, will likely want to have a signed contract that cuts them in on some fraction OF any such profits.  Given the YEARS of meticulous work that went into making these scans, and the fact that libraries usually are NOT rolling in money, this seems to me a VERY reasonable position for Tamiment Library to take!

Note that neither I, the Riazanov Library digital archive project, nor the Marxist Internet Archive web site have any formal association with Tamiment library.  But we, again, are most grateful to Tamiment Library for having done such a superlative and meticulous job of preserving and allowing to be widely shared this famous and beautiful left journal... original copies of which will not long exist.  All copies of The Masses are all now highly brittle, and in the process of turning into little bits of confetti, each with a letter or line or two on them.

PS Technical Note:

These scans appear to be approximately 275 dpi resolution.  It is likely Tamiment's original raw images were higher resolution.  I was told by the late Dr. Michael Nash that full resolution images from this project would be made avaiable to the public.  It is my hope Tamiment Library will do this.  This note is being written before the release of the scans... just after downloading all of the "for general distribution via Tamiment web site" scans were put up on a beta test site.
